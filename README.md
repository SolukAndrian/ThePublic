To start my application, you need to download and confugure your apache Tomcat 9.0.0 in your development environment.

This is simple social-network. 
Each user can login or registration into system. 
When you login into system you have possibility for searching people,  sending request to friend, adding people to friend, and writing messages. Also, you can restore your password.
Feeling fine using my project=)
